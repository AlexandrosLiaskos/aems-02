This edition of thesify [https://app.thesify.ai/?utm_source=thesifyai&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=free14.08.25] Weekly takes a closer look at the rubber duck method, a technique mentioned in our conversation with Dr. Michael Meeuwis [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCxih0fBvsg] that deserves its own spotlight. Speaking your argument aloud to a silent plastic “listener” can expose gaps in logic, tangled phrasing, and unsupported claims faster than re-reading ever could. This week’s blog post, Preserving Your Academic Voice in the AI Era [https://www.thesify.ai/blog/preserving-academic-voice-ai], goes well beyond the duck, sharing practical ways to maintain clarity, originality, and authority while ensuring AI tools support rather than replace your thinking. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This Week at thesify: Inside the Mind of a Professor The newest episode in thesify’s interview [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCxih0fBvsg] series features Dr. Michael Meeuwis, Professor of English at the University of Warwick [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/people/drmichaelmeeuwis/]. In this candid conversation, he explains how AI is changing academic writing and what it takes to preserve originality, clarity, and authorship. From close reading to mindful drafting, he shares strategies every student and researcher can apply. Watch the Interview on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCxih0fBvsg] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This Week’s Blog: Preserving Your Academic Voice in the AI Era Your academic voice comes from the way you select evidence, build analysis, and draw conclusions. This post shares practical strategies for protecting that voice while using AI responsibly. It covers close reading, mindful drafting, targeted feedback, and aligning every source with your thesis. Drawing on insights from Dr. Michael Meeuwis, it explains how to use AI to refine and test your work while keeping authorship firmly in your hands. Read the full post [https://www.thesify.ai/blog/preserving-academic-voice-ai] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your Weekly Tips: Making the Rubber Duck Work for You 1. Interrogate each step of your reasoning aloud Select a short but significant section of your draft and explain it to a silent “listener.” This could be a rubber duck, a figurine, or even a coffee mug. The value lies in hearing your own logic without external prompts or cues. As you speak, listen for points where you hesitate, reorder thoughts mid-sentence, or need to backtrack. These are likely places where your reasoning is either unclear or incomplete on the page. 2. Use stumbles as a map for revision When you lose momentum while explaining, resist the urge to dismiss it as a speaking slip. In writing, these same weak points will cause readers to slow down or misinterpret your claim. Mark these areas in your draft and work on clarifying connections, tightening evidence, or making assumptions explicit. Treat each stumble as a signal of structural work to be done, not a minor polish issue. 3. Turn thesify’s suggested topics into prompts Before you revise, run your draft through thesify’s feedback report and look at the Suggested Topics section, shown in the screenshot below. Each question is tailored to your discipline and identifies areas your draft has not yet addressed. [https://smonk.mjt.lu/img2/smonk/b38afd82-937d-473f-9ead-3b7b45c92aeb/content] Treat these as prompts for your rubber duck session, speaking through answers aloud to surface gaps in logic or evidence. This not only makes the feedback actionable but also ensures your revisions directly strengthen the conceptual backbone of your work. 4.Confirm your revisions through repetition After making targeted changes, return to the same section and speak it through again. If the flow holds steady and the logic feels complete, you have likely resolved the original problem. If not, the method will expose new points to refine. Over time, this cycle sharpens your ability to anticipate where readers will need more clarity and ensures your argument is structurally sound before you seek AI feedback. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Related Resources * thesify Weekly Newsletter Archive: [https://thesify.substack.com/] Each week, we share practical tips on writing, revision, and academic strategy.
